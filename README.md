# Solar System Explorer: A Three.js and React Project

Welcome to the Solar System Explorer project! This interactive application allows you to explore our solar system in 3D, providing an immersive experience of our neighboring planets. Using the power of Three.js and React, this project brings to life the beauty and wonder of the cosmos right in your browser.

## Features

- **Fully Explorable Solar System:** Immerse yourself in a 3D representation of our solar system. Hold down the mouse button and drag to navigate around the space. Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel to get a closer look at the celestial bodies.

- **Planet Information:** Click on any planet to access detailed information about it. Learn about the planet's rotational period (length of one day), gravity, and discover some intriguing and captivating facts that make each planet unique.

- **Stunning Visuals:** The planets are created using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics. The shaders used for rendering the planets add a realistic touch, making the experience visually captivating.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solarsystem.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd solarsystem
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to explore the solar system!

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The user interface and components are built using React, making it easy to manage the application's state and components.

- **Three.js:** This library provides the core functionality for creating 3D graphics in the browser. It's used to render the planets and create their realistic visual effects.

## Credits

- Solar System data and information sourced from reputable astronomical sources.
- Shaders and 3D models for the planets created using Three.js examples and resources.
- This project was developed by Kelsey Mickleberry as a demonstration of integrating React and Three.js for educational and entertainment purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more celestial bodies like moons, asteroids, and comets for a more complete experience.
- Implement additional interactive features, such as toggling between different views or adding educational overlays.
- Optimize performance and responsiveness for different screen sizes and devices.
